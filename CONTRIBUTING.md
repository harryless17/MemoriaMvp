# Contributing to Memoria

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Memoria! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3. **Set up Supabase** following the README instructions
4. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Keep changes focused**: One feature or fix per PR
2. **Follow existing patterns**: Match the code style and structure
3. **Test thoroughly**: Test on both web and mobile if applicable
4. **Update documentation**: Update README or add comments for complex code

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any`
- **Components**: Keep them small and focused (< 200 lines ideally)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `handleSubmitComment` not `submit`)
- **Formatting**: Run `pnpm format` before committing

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add video thumbnail generation
fix: resolve upload queue retry logic
docs: update setup instructions
refactor: simplify media grid component
```

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Lint
pnpm lint

```
